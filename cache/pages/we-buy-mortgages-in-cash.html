<h1>Got a Note to Sell?</h1>
<p>Do you have a note that a borrower is paying you monthly payments on-time on?  Do you want to turn your performing note into a lump sum of cash? We buy performing notes for cash. If you have owner-financed your property and want a lump sum of cash on, call us for a free quote.  We prefer to buy notes secured by residential properties and commercial retail properties. We pay for all closing costs &amp; due diligence such as title, appraisal, and insurance.</p>
